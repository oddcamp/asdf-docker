# Odd Camp asdf Docker Image

This docker image(s) are used in our development environments. We use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) to be able to switch node/yarn versions with ease.

## Dockerfile

Here is the standardized `Dockerfile` (it changes between language and projects though) we use here at [Odd Camp](https://www.oddcamp.com):

```Docker
FROM docker.pkg.github.com/oddcamp/asdf-docker/ruby:2.7.1

# Setup environment variables that will be available to the instance
ARG GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ENV APP_HOME /app
ENV GEM_HOME /asdf/.gems
ENV GEM_PATH /asdf/.gems

USER root
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y tzdata
RUN apt-get install -y libv8-dev pkg-config libpq-dev
RUN mkdir -p $APP_HOME
RUN chown -R asdf:asdf $APP_HOME

# CD the folder
USER asdf
WORKDIR $APP_HOME

# Add any missing tools
ADD .tool-versions $APP_HOME
RUN cd $APP_HOME
RUN asdf install
RUN asdf current

# Fix gem path
RUN mkdir -p "$GEM_PATH" && chown asdf:asdf "$GEM_PATH"
RUN gem install bundler

# Needs to be run inside of the folder that has .tool-versions
RUN npm config set @kollegorna:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com/
RUN echo "//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}" >> ~/.npmrc

# Needed due to docker volumes only give you root:root chown by default.
RUN mkdir -p "$APP_HOME/tmp/cache" && chown asdf:asdf "$APP_HOME/tmp/cache"
RUN mkdir -p "$APP_HOME/node_modules" && chown asdf:asdf "$APP_HOME/node_modules"
```

## NodeJS

Use our standardized `Dockerfile` and it should grab the version from `.tool-versions` on build.

If you change the version at anytime you will have to rebuild the image as that is built on build.

### Versions

Versions is handled by `asdf` so any version you use in your `.tool-versions` will be used and downloaded on build.

Use the `FROM` image such as `FROM docker.pkg.github.com/oddcamp/asdf-docker/nodejs:latest`.

## Ruby

Ruby doesn't provide a good way of just downloading an executable like how NodeJS does it. So we have several images with different ruby versions that have Ruby pre-compiled.

A new project **should always** use the latest Rails-supported version.

### Versions

Currently supported versions:

- 2.4.9 (end of life march 2020)
- 2.6.4
- 2.6.5
- 2.6.6
- 2.7.1
- 2.7.2
- 2.7.3
- 3.0.3
- 3.1.0

Use the `FROM` image such as `FROM docker.pkg.github.com/oddcamp/asdf-docker/ruby:2.7.1`.

### Bundler and Github Private Packages

If you are using a private package on Github in your bundler-based projects you can use these environment variables in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```
    environment:
      BUNDLE_GITHUB__COM: "${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic"
      BUNDLE_RUBYGEMS__PKG__GITHUB__COM: "${GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN}:x-oauth-basic"
```

That way you wouldn't need to rebuild the whole image if you missed setting up the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.
